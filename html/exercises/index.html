   <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1> <!-- h1 goes here -->
    <ol>
      <li> I get to use my brain in new and exciting ways.</li>
      <li>It's like working with puzzles.</li>
      <li>The feeling of finding a solution to a problem is unmatched by anything else.</li>

    <p>Once I've developed my coding skills, the first thing I want to make is a dice roller for a Tabletop RPG system called Savage Worlds. It will have the ability to roll dice, and when dice roll their max value, they roll again and add the new number to the first. It will also have access to Savage Worlds Character Sheets so players can keep everything in one place. This will help those who play virtually as well as in person. You can still play if you forget all your gear!</p><!-- p goes here -->
